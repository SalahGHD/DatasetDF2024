Multimodal Dataset for traffic control
This work presents a novel multimodal dataset which is the first of its kind, its scraped
from England Highways, incorporating speed, flow, and camera images for the M60, M25, and M1 motorways. The 
dataset provides a comprehensive view of traffic behaviour at
specific junctions, enabling detailed analysis and real-world
applications. By integrating previously disparate data sources,
this dataset offers a valuable resource for understanding and
optimizing traffic control and management. 

this folder contains the dataset, including the gathering of speed and
flow data, and the use of image scraping techniques to capture
CCTV images.
